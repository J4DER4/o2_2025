 * A workout with sequences. (16 tasks, each a line or so of code.)
 *
 * This exercise rehearses your skills in working with
 * sequences in Scala. It may be useful to look at
 * the documentation of the Sequence (Seq) API:
 *
 * http://www.scala-lang.org/api/3.3.3/scala/collection/Seq.html

  import java.lang.module.ModuleDescriptor.Requires

  /*
   * Task 1:
   * Practice with _mapping_ a function over a sequence.
   *
   * Define a function that adds one (+1) to every element
   * of a given sequence ('in') of integers and returns the resulting
   * sequence.
   *
   * Hints:
   * You may want to 'map' over the sequence a function that adds one.
   * You may define the function that adds one either explicitly,
   * or practice the use of anonymous functions.

  /*
   * Task 2:
   * Practice with _filtering_ a sequence.
   *
   * Define a function that returns a sequence where
   * all __odd__ integers from the input sequence have been deleted.
   *
   * Hints:

   * Recall that a POSITIVE integer x is odd if and only if ((x%2)==1) is true.
   * For negative integers one must take into account that modulo operator %
   * in scala returns the SIGNED remainder, and therefore (-3)%2 == -1.
   * For more information see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo.
   * 
   * You may want to 'filter' the sequence with a function that
   * returns 'true' if and only if the input integer is not odd
   * (i.e. the integer is even). This is more straightforward since
   * there is no remainder (i.e. it is 0) and the sign is not a problem.
   * 
   * You may define the function that tests for even-ness
   * either explicitly, or practice the use of anonymous functions.

   * operator that satisfies the associative property,
   * such as '+', '*', 'min', 'max', sequence concatenation ('++'),
   * and so forth.
   *
   * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property
   *
   * Here we practice reduction with '+', that is, we want
   * to take the _sum_ of the elements of a sequence.
   *
   * Your task is to define a function that returns the sum of
   * the integers in the (nonempty) input sequence.
   *
   * Remark:
   * Please do not use the library method 'sum' to solve this task.

   * the odd integers in the input.
   * (You may assume that there is at least one odd integer in the input.)
   *
   * Hint:
   * Let us think about how to do this by applying a _cascade_ of
   * transformations, one after another. Perhaps we would want to
   *
   *  (1) first, filter the even integers out so that only odd integers remain,
   *  (2) then, map each remaining integer to its square, and
   *  (3) finally, reduce by taking the sum of the squares.
   *

  /*
   * Task 7:
   * Let us now practice working with sequences of __pairs__.
   *
   * So far we have worked with sequences of integers. Let us
   * now play a bit with sequences that consist of __pairs__ of integers.
   *
   * Recall that in Scala a pair is an object x of type Tuple2[A,B],
   * or more succinctly, type (A,B) , where A and B are the types of
   * the components of x.
   *
   * For example, if we are working with a pair x of integers
   * both with type Int, the pair x has type Tuple2[Int,Int],
   * or more succinctly, (Int,Int) .
   *
   * If x is a pair, we can get the first position of x
   * (e.g. the first integer in x) by writing
   *
   *      x._1
   *
   * Similarly, we can get the second position of x by writing
   *
   *      x._2
   *
   * An alternative way to handle pairs and tuples in general is
   * to use pattern matching, see https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/tuples.html.
   * Basically, if we have a class called Pixel with a method .getRGB() which
   * returns the RGB value of the pixel as one tuple of 3 Ints, we could write
   * code in the following way:
   *
   *    val pix: Pixel = ...        // a Pixel object (defined by some class)
   *    val rgbTuple = pix.getRGB() // Get the red, green, and blue colours as a tuple (r,g,b)
   *    val red = rgbTuple._1       // separate red
   *    val green = rgbTuple._2     // separate green
   *    val blue = rgbTuple._3      // separate blue
   * 
   * Bit, this takes 4 rows to get the components separated nicely if we want to
   * avoid using the rgbTuple._X in the long run. A more succinct way to write this
   * is the following:
   *
   *    val pix: Pixel = ...        // a Pixel variable pix has been defined in some way
   *    val (red, green, blue) = pix.getRGB()   // assign each color to different variables immediately
   * 
   * When working with sequences using higher order functions (like .map())
   * we can also take advantage of pattern mathing. If we have a Seq of
   * the previously discussed rgb values
   * 
   *    val seq: Seq[(Int, Int, Int))] = ...
   * 
   * and we want to map it to a sequence of just the green values,
   * we can do any of the following:
   *
   *    seq.map(_._2)
   *    seq.map(rgb => rgb._2)
   *    seq.map((_,g,_) => g)
   * 
   * 
   * So suppose now we are given as input a __sequence__ of
   * pairs of integers (that is, an object of type Seq[Tuple2[Int,Int]],
   * or more succinctly, Seq[(Int,Int)] ).
   *
   * Your task is to define a function that returns a sequence consisting
   * of the second positions of the pairs whose first position is even.
   *
   * Hint:
   * Again you may want to use a cascade.
   * First, filter based on the first position,
   * then, map with a function that returns the second position of a pair.
   *

  /*
   * Task 8:
   * Let us continue working with sequences of pairs.
   *
   * Define a function that computes the product of each pair of integers
   * in the input sequence, and then takes the sum of these products.

  /*
   * Task 9:
   * Here we learn the useful idiom of _zipping_ two given sequences
   * (with the same length) into one sequence of pairs.
   *
   * In short, it often happens that you have two sequences, a and b,
   * and you need to do something to the elements in matching
   * positions in those sequences. That is, you want to work with
   * the elements a(i) and b(i) for each position
   * i=0,1,...,min(a.length,b.length)-1
   *
   * Clearly this is a situation where one would like to use a 'map',
   * but unfortunately map only works on the elements of one sequence.
   * The solution is to __zip__ the sequences a and b to produce a
   * sequence consisting of the pairs (a(i),b(i)) for each i.
   * To zip a with b, we call the 'zip' method of a:
   *
   *    a.zip(b)
   *
   * or what is the same using operator syntax,
   *
   *    a zip b
   *
   * The result is a sequence z such that z(i) is the pair (a(i),b(i))
   * for all i=0,1,...,min(a.length,b.length)-1.
   *
   * All right. So let us now practice zipping.
   *
   * Let us start with something really simple. Suppose we have
   * two sequences of integers, a and b, both of length d.
   * We may view these sequences as d-dimensional vectors.
   * So how do we compute the sum of these two vectors?
   * Clearly, the sum s = a + b should satisfy s(i) == a(i) + b(i)
   * for each i = 0,1,...,d-1.
   *
   * So why not 'zip' the two sequences, to obtain a sequence
   * of pairs (a(i),b(i)). Then, to form the sum vector,
   * all we need is a 'map' that sums up each pair ...

  /*
   * Task 12:
   * Taking and dropping combined with zipping.
   *
   * Sequences have two useful methods, take(j: Int) and drop(j: Int),
   * that take or drop the _first_ (=lowest-numbered) j positions
   * of the sequence and return the resulting sequence.
   * There are also dual methods, takeRight(j: Int) and dropRight(j: Int),
   * that take or drop the _last_ (=highest-numbered) j positions

   *

   * sequences so that the sequences offset relative to one another
   * by, say, j positions. In more precise terms,

   * i = 0,1,...,d-1-j. Define a function that carries out such
   * pairing between elements of a and b, and returns the resulting

  /*
   * Task 14:

   *
   * Often it is necessary to work with the elements of a sequence
   * (e.g. using a 'map') in such a way that we have access to
   * the position where the element occurs. In such cases it is useful
   * to first zip the original sequence with a sequence of its indices.
   * That is, each element in the sequence gets paired
   * with its index (its position number) in the sequence.
   * While we could do this with a quick idiom such as
   *
   *     a zip (0 until a.length)
   *
   * there is in fact a separate method in class Seq that does precisely
   * this, namely 'zipWithIndex', so precisely the same what is above
   * is achieved more succinctly by
   *
   *     a.zipWithIndex
   *
   * Let us now look at an example why zipping with the index is useful.
   * Suppose you have a sequence of integers and you need to find
   * the index where the (first occurrence of the) maximum value in the
   * sequence occurs. That is, if a(i) is the maximum of a, we need to
   * find out i for the minimum such i.
   * Implement a method that uses zipWithIndex to find the first
   * index with the maximum value in the sequence a.
   *
   * Remark:
   * There is also a method available for finding the first index
   * of a maximum. However, you should not solve this exercise
   * by calling that method.

  /*
   * Task 15:
   * Unzipping.
   *
   * Given all this practice with zipping, one might wonder whether
   * it makes sense to sometimes 'unzip' as well. Perhaps not surprisingly,
   * it does, and there is a method 'unzip' available for such situations.
   *
   * One example is as follows. A key operation in the Haar wavelet transform
   * is to take two sequences a and b as input, and produce a pair of
   * two sequences as output, namely the elementwise (vector) sum a+b and
