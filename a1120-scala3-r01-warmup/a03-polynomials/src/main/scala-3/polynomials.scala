package polynomials

/*
 * Your tasks (indicated with 'Task X' below):
 *
 * Task 1:
 * Implement mutable internal state (=current value) for Variables. 
 * Complete the 'set' and 'value' methods in class Variable,
 * and the 'value' method in class Constant.
 *
 * Task 2:
 * Implement polynomial value computation using structural recursion.
 * Complete the 'value' methods in all the classes extending Polynomial.
 * Hint: you may want to take a look at how the method 'asString' 
 * is implemented. 
 *
 * Task 3:
 * Implement programmer-defined operators to ease working with Polynomial 
 * objects. That is, complete the methods '*' and '+' in class Polynomial 
 * so that you may use the operators '*' and '+' to construct Product and 
 * Sum objects from Polynomial objects. For more on operators in Scala, 
 * see here
 *
 *    http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/tour/operators.html
