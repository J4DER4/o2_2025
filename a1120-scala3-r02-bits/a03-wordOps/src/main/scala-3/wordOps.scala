 * Assignment:  Word operations

 * Description:
 * This assignment asks you to implement common word operations that are
 * not available in the Scala programming language. The intent is to practice
 * your skills at working with bits.

 * Task 1: Population count (number of 1-bits in a word)

 * Task 2: Reverse bit positions
 *
 * Complete the following function that takes as parameter
 * a 16-bit word, w, and returns a 16-bit word, r, such that
 * for every j=0,1,...,15,
 * the value of the bit at position j in r is equal to

 * Task 3: Left rotation
 *
 * Complete the following function that takes two parameters
 *
 * 1) a 64-bit word, w, and
 * 2) a 32-bit word, k.
 *
 * The function returns a 64-bit word, r, such that
 * for all j=0,1,...,63
 * the value of the bit at position (j+k)%64 in r is equal to
 * the value of the bit at position j in w.
