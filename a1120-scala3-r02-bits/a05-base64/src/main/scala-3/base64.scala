/*
 * Assignment:  Base64 data encoding (RFC 4648)
 *
 * Motivation:
 * Suppose you can communicate with your friend only by means of text.
 * For example, suppose you can send e-mail to your friend, but an
 * e-mail message may consist only of printable characters of ASCII text.
 * You would nevertheless like to transmit binary data (an array of bytes)
 * to your friend. This requires that you send your data to your
 * friend __encoded as text__. A common binary-to-text encoding scheme
 * is __Base64 data encoding__, as specified in RFC 4648.
 *
 * Reference to Base64 data encoding (RFC 4648):
 *
 *   http://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc4648
 *
 * (see also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64 )
 *
 * Description:
 * This assignment asks you to implement an __encoding function__ for plain
 * Base64 encoding. The intent is to practice your skills at working with
 * bits and strings. We give you a __decoding function__ for reference.
 *
 * Remark:
 * The RFC ("Request for Comments") series is the publication vehicle for
 * technical specifications and policy documents produced by the
 * IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), the IAB (Internet Architecture
 * Board), or the IRTF (Internet Research Task Force).

 * Task 1:
 * Let us build the encoder in steps so that we can unit-test each step

 * of three 8-bit words P,Q,R (instead of an 8-bit word we actually use
 * the least significant 8 bits of an Int) and returns a 24-bit word U
 * with the following content:
 *
 * PPPPPPPPQQQQQQQQRRRRRRRR
 * 765432107654321076543210 (bit positions in words P,Q,R)
 *
  Make sure that you take only the least significant 8 bits of each argument P,Q,R into account.

/*
 * Task 2:
 * Next, write an encoding function that breaks the previous 24-bit word U
 * into a sequence of four 6-bit words X,Y,Z,W as follows:
 *
 * XXXXXXYYYYYYZZZZZZWWWWWW
 * 543210543210543210543210 (bit positions in words X,Y,Z,W)
 *
 * The return value r should have (in the least significant 6 bits of an
 * Int in each case): r(0) == X, r(1) == Y, r(2) == Z, and r(3) == W.

/*
 * Task 3:
 * We now ask you to write a restricted Base64 encoder that
 * assumes that the length of the input (in bytes) is a multiple
 * of 3. That is, the encoder needs not to worry about padding.
 *
 * Hints:
 * You may use the "grouped" method in class IndexedSeq[Byte] to split
 * the input array b into blocks of three 8-bit words. Then use
 * the previous functions and the string "B64" defined above to
 * build an array of characters, which you can turn into a string
 * by a calling a constructor for class String with the array as parameter.
 *
 * See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64 for examples.
