/**
  * A simple class representing pixels, constructed using the Int representation
  * of RGBA color value. This means that different channels are packed into the Int
  * as (hi bis) RRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGBBBBBBBBAAAAAAAA (low bits), where R = red channel,
  * G = green channel, B = blue channel and A = alpha channel. Color value is immutable.
  * 
  * The reason why we would want to pack all of the color components into a single Int
  * is that the values for each color channel, at least in the usual RGB cases range from
  * 0 to 255. This means that we only need 8 bits per component, and therefore storing
  * only one color component in an Int would waste 24 bits. However, as 4*8 = 32, we
  * can store EXACTLY 4 such components in the storage space associated with a single
  * Int if we pack them properly. This also happens the number of channels in RGBA,
  * where RGB are the familiar Red, Green and Blue channels, and A is the alpha channel
  * representing the transparency of that pixel. For more information see
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGBA_color_model
